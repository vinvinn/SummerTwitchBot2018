# SummerTwitchBot2018

This project runs a twitch bot via a NodeJS server to execute custom commands. The server handles all interactions with twitch and the database, and also sends information to the p5.js sketch. The sketch is the "game" view of the project, and using [Open Broadcasting Software](https://obsproject.com/), is what is streamed live to twitch for viewers to see and interact with. On a general level it shows how one could write and create their own custom twitch bot, and even utilize a database for their bot.
